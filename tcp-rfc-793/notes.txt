TCP is a protocol which provides robustness in the presence of communication
unreliability and avilability in the precense of congestion.

TCP assumes it can obtain a simple, potentially unreliable datagram service from
the lower level protocols.

The TCP interfaces on one side to user or application processes and on the other
side to a lower level protocol such as Internet Protocol.

    - Socket interface
    - Very minimal interface to IP layer which is just being able to pass data

Reliability: must recover from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated or
delivered out of order. Sequence numbers, timeouts, checksums

Flow control: receiver can govern the amount of data sent by the sender. Window

Multiplexing: assigns port numbers to allow many processes within a single host
to use TCP communication simultaneously

Connections: TCP needs to initialize and maintain certain status information for
each data stream, which makes up a connection. This connection needs to be
established and freed
